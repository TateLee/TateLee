Hi, I am Taehyeon (Or Tate) and currently studying in Trinity College Dublin.
I'm studying Engineering right now.

Main languages I can use is Korean, English, Japanese and am learning German now.

Just kidding!

I learned C++ and little bit of Matlab at school.
My aim is to learn coding to integrate with some Engineering problems I will encounter.
Thank you for your supports!
